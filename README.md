# A Guide to Linux YouTubers (and who are actually worth watching)

Interest in the Linux desktop has been growing over the past few years and with Microsoft ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025, many users are looking at Linux as a viable option.

Although there are many informative articles on Linux and Linux distributions on the web, I suspect many would rather watch and hear from a YouTuber who has experience with Linux and can share their own journey.

Below is a list I compiled of the most popular Linux YouTubers with at least 50,000 subscribers. I have ranked them into tiers, based on discussions found on social media and polls conducted on Discord. If you think I have missed any big channels that deserve to be on this list or that any information is blatantly incorrect, feel free to submit a pull request.

### [Distrotube](https://www.youtube.com/@DistroTube) (261,000 subscribers)

> A channel catering more to the "power user". Although people have been doing distribution reviews long before he started his channel, his reviews were some of the most popular and helped grow his channel to the size it is today.

+ ✅ Has some great videos and series about software, text editors, working in the terminal, command-line tools, scripting, and customizing your desktop experience.
+ ✅ His many videos on window managers and customization go into greater detail than others on the platform.
+ ✅ Highlights Free Open Source Software (FOSS).

- ❌ Although they made him popular, his distro reviews add nothing of value anymore and can be considered filler and repetitive content.
- ❌ Has some controversial and polarizing opinions on politics.
- ❌ Has begun to rehash content he has made in the past.

## Tier D

### [Tech Hut](https://www.youtube.com/@TechHut) (237,000 subscribers)

> A beginner-friendly Linux channel more focused on homelabbing and servers these days. If you are into starting a homelab, there are more focused channels out there, but if you want quick, surface level knowledge, Tech Hut will fit the bill.

+ ✅ Delves into home server setups and server software, but also looks at hardware, distros, and does gaming-related content.
+ ✅ Reviews more hardware (mostly server-related) than a lot of the other big Linux channels.
+ ✅ Occasionally reviews phones that can run Linux, which is not something many others channels look at.
+ ✅ Uploads frequently with fresh content.
+ ✅ Friendly personality and engages with his audience.

- ❌ Limited depth as he covers a wide range of topics.

### [Luke Smith](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeSmithxyz) (218,000 subscribers)

> Despite being inactive on YouTube for almost 2 years, he remains one of the most well-known and influential Linux YouTubers. He is most famous for his window manager and customization videos, but also his philosophical commentary and lifestyle vlogs. Many have copied his presentation style over the years.

+ ✅ Has some genuinely useful tutorial videos on scripting, the shell, configuring software, and setting up the Linux desktop to fit your needs.
+ ✅ Emphasizes minimalism and efficiency in computing.
+ ✅ Showcases and promotes quality free and open source software.

- ❌ Off-putting personality. Arrogant, abrasive, dismissive, and overly critical.
- ❌ Has some extreme political views, religious beliefs, and strong opinions.
- ❌ Uses meme thumbnails to attract young viewers.
- ❌ Cryptobro.

### [Brodie Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/@BrodieRobertson) (99,000 subscribers)

> Started out as a Distrotube and Luke Smith clone, doing the usual window manager and command-line tool related videos. Since then, he has shifted to something more akin to The Linux Experiment, but focuses on the more technical side of Linux.

+ ✅ Covers a wide range of news topics.
+ ✅ His news videos contain technical information that may be more digestible to those who prefer videos to reading.
+ ✅ If you are more into the technical side of Linux and what is going on behind the scenes, this channel at least saves you from having to Google stuff or go to a news site yourself.
+ ✅ Occasionally interviews developers in the Linux space. The guests are quite good, but Robertson could improve on his interviewing skills.
+ ✅ Has some good tutorial videos that are still relevant.

- ❌ Opinions are not always his own. Despite previously having a banner on his YouTube page stating: "All opinions are my own, I don't use a script.", Robertson will read GitHub/Lab comment pages, mailing lists, and news articles word for word in his videos. This is considered low effort content and you certainly don't need a script for this. Very rarely does he share an original or insightful opinion.
- ❌ Posts a video every day, but a lot are repetitive topics with limited depth. He is clearly chasing the YouTube algorithm and AdSense revenue.
- ❌ His delivery style and the way he accentuates his words may turn off viewers.
- ❌ Has been known to gatekeep and has been critical of Windows users on numerous occasions.

## Tier F

### [Craig Titus Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisTitusTech) (680,000 subscribers)

> Started out as a Windows / virtualization channel, but he soon realized no one is interested in the former, and that there are better channels out there in regards to the latter. Seeing the popularity of Linux channels, he quickly re-branded himself as a Linux-focused channel. When not recording, he is still a full-time Windows user.

+ ✅ Some of his more popular how-to videos may be beneficial to beginners.

- ❌ Has a surface level knowledge of Linux, but has made claims to be an expert in the field, and thinks he is qualified to educate his users on more advanced subjects.
- ❌ Has claimed to be a former Windows system administrator for a Fortune 500 company. There is no proof of this and the only thing confirmed about his employment history is that he ran a small IT repair shop in Texas.
- ❌ As of recent, he has claimed to be a professional programmer. Anyone who has watched his channel in the past, knows of his poorly written and buggy scripts that almost never worked. With the advent of ChatGPT, Titus took full advantage of the software to "learn". He now uses ChatGPT, as well as other LLMs, to write code for him. He then takes this code to GitHub, where users fix and polish the code he has cobbled together.
- ❌ His criticisms on certain distributions and desktop environments are nonsensical.
- ❌ Makes awful clickbait thumbnails in the vein of Linus Tech Tips.

### [The Linux Cast](https://www.youtube.com/@TheLinuxCast) (63,000 subscribers)

> A run-of-the-mill Linux YouTuber who took off due to his simplistic tutorials and learning as you go video style. Unfortunately he adds nothing to the space, with a lot of repetitive content. Furthermore, his personality has become more negative over time.

+ ✅ If you are looking for window manager customization videos (also known as "ricing") where you can follow along, some of his videos may be of use.

- ❌ His worst offense is trying to educate his users on a subject he knows nothing about. Most of his tutorial videos are made when he himself is just starting to use and learn said software, and he doesn't even know what he is doing half the time. He often spouts completely incorrect information and ignores important details when trying to explain things. Attempting to correct him in the YouTube comment section will only bring his wrath.
- ❌ Has criticized other Linux YouTubers for their distro reviews and has called distro reviews pointless. While the latter is fair in some regards, he continues to do distro reviews himself, but thinks that by doing them long-term, it adds more value.
- ❌ He is known for being what's called a "distrohopper", bouncing from distro to distro, because he is never satisfied. If something does not work the way he likes, he will criticize the distro for having problems, whether that is true or not. Instead of trying to troubleshoot, he will blame the distribution for its problems, and jump ship to another.
- ❌ When a piece of software doesn't work the way he wants or he just refuses to learn, he simply calls it garbage, and blames the developers. He has no respect for them at all. Instead of providing insight or contributing in any meaningful way, he would rather just hurl insults and move along.
- ❌ Rambles in all of his videos. You could cut almost all his videos in half because of this.
- ❌ Calls himself "The Eternal Noob of Linux" and while that may be true, he uses it as an excuse for his mistakes and his unwillingness to learn.
